<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>As a Google Summer of Code Project my task was to implement some awaited features that aim at enhancing the flexibility and versatility of the Sigmah project keeping in view the new requirements suggested and feedback provided by the users. I mainly worked around project model management part of the project.</p>
